    <h4>Ingredients for the tiramisu</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>6 large Egg yolks, are essential for a thick, rich, velvety smooth filling. Though some traditional recipes use raw eggs, this one doesn't — raw eggs carry the risk of food-borne illness.</li>
        <li>3/4 cup White sugar, is cooked with egg yolks and combined with mascarpone to create a sweet, creamy filling.</li>
        <li>2/3 cup Whole milk, slightly thins the thick filling, resulting in a spreadable texture.</li>
        <li>Beat 1 1/4 cups heavy cream until stiff peaks form to create an irresistible whipped cream.</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Vanilla extract, adds subtle flavor to the homemade whipped cream.</li>
        <li>1 pound Mascarpone, a creamy Italian cheese with a smooth texture and fresh taste, is a key ingredient in classic tiramisu.</li>
        <li>Ladyfingers are soaked in strong,1.4 cup spiked coffee — this is what gives tiramisu its signature flavor.</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Rum is used to spike the coffee that will be drizzled over the ladyfingers. Some Allrecipes community members say they prefer Kahlua.</li>
        <li>2 or 3 ounce packages Ladyfingers are small sponge cakes that are shaped like thick fingers. If you can't find ladyfingers at your grocery store, you can use pound cake cut into strips.</li>
        <li>Finish off this decadent dessert with a generous dusting of cocoa powder.</li>
    </ul>
